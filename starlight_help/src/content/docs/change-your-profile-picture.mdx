When you first create an account, you'll have an automatically generated profile
picture in the style [configured](/help/configure-default-profile-pictures) by
your organization. You can upload a custom profile picture for your Zulip account.

When you create a Zulip account using an email address already associated with
an account in another Zulip organization, on Zulip Cloud or the same self-hosted
Zulip installation, you can [import](/help/import-your-settings) your profile
picture and other settings from an existing account.

If your organization has configured [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) as the
default for profile pictures, and your email address already has a gravatar
associated with it, Zulip will use your existing gravatar.

Organization administrators can [restrict profile picture
changes](/help/restrict-profile-picture-changes).
