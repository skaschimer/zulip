You can configure the style of profile pictures for users who don't have a
profile picture uploaded.

* The default option is an abstract design that looks good in both the
  light and dark [themes](/help/dark-theme).
* [Gravatar](https://en.gravatar.com/) lets users link a profile picture to
  their email account, which is used across all applications that support it.
  The default for users who don't have a gravatar configured is an abstract
  design best suited for light theme.
